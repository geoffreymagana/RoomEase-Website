# Google Apps Script Setup for RoomEase Survey

This guide will help you set up the Google Apps Script to handle survey form submissions and store them in a Google Sheet.

## Prerequisites

1. A Google account
2. Access to Google Sheets
3. Access to Google Apps Script

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create a Google Sheet

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Create a new spreadsheet
3. Note down the spreadsheet ID from the URL (it's the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Remove any trailing slashes from the ID
   - Example: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YbNJdHnixDJP56rQS_1rVDURARcQBo6P4jrbBz_XmAo/edit`
   - Spreadsheet ID: `1YbNJdHnixDJP56rQS_1rVDURARcQBo6P4jrbBz_XmAo` (no trailing slash)

### 2. Create Google Apps Script

1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Replace the default code with the content from `google-apps-script.js`
4. Update the `SPREADSHEET_ID` variable with your actual spreadsheet ID (without trailing slash)

### 3. Deploy the Script

1. Click "Deploy" â†’ "New deployment"
2. Choose "Web app" as the type
3. Set the following options:
   - **Execute as**: Me
   - **Who has access**: Anyone
4. Click "Deploy"
5. Copy the web app URL (you'll need this for the environment variables)

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec
```

**Note**: For Google Apps Script, you typically don't need an API key since the script is deployed as a web app with "Anyone" access.

### 5. Test the Setup

1. Visit your web app URL in a browser
2. You should see a JSON response indicating the API is running
3. Submit a test survey from your website
4. Check your Google Sheet to see if the data was added

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Spreadsheet not found" error**
   - Make sure the spreadsheet ID is correct (no trailing slash)
   - Ensure the spreadsheet is shared with your Google account
   - Check that you have edit permissions on the spreadsheet

2. **"Script not found" error**
   - Check that the script is deployed as a web app
   - Verify the web app URL is correct
   - Make sure "Who has access" is set to "Anyone"

3. **CORS errors**
   - The script now includes proper CORS headers
   - If you still get CORS errors, try testing the web app URL directly in a browser first

4. **Permission denied**
   - Make sure the web app is deployed with "Anyone" access
   - Check that your Google account has permission to access the spreadsheet
   - Ensure the spreadsheet is not in a restricted folder

5. **"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'insertSheet')"**
   - This means the spreadsheet object is null
   - Check that the SPREADSHEET_ID is correct
   - Ensure you have access to the spreadsheet

6. **"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'postData')"**
   - This happens when the script is called without proper POST data
   - Make sure you're calling the web app URL, not running the function directly

### Testing the Script

You can test the script manually by:

1. Opening the Google Apps Script editor
2. Running the `doGet()` function to test basic connectivity
3. Running the `testCreateSheet()` function to test spreadsheet access
4. Checking your Google Sheet for the new "Survey Responses" tab

### Debugging Steps

1. **Test Web App URL**: Visit your web app URL directly in a browser
   - Should return: `{"success":true,"message":"RoomEase Survey API is running","timestamp":"..."}`

2. **Test Spreadsheet Access**: Run `testCreateSheet()` in the Apps Script editor
   - Should create a new sheet tab if it doesn't exist

3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the spreadsheet is shared with your Google account

4. **Verify Deployment**: Make sure the web app is deployed with correct settings

## Security Considerations

- The current setup allows anyone to submit to your sheet
- For production use, consider adding authentication
- You can restrict access by changing "Who has access" to "Anyone with Google account"
